_Erlang BEAM emulator in Haskell_

Introduction
------------

This project aims to implement an emulator to run Erlang's BEAM code.
The emulator itself is implemented in Haskell.
I've used various sources to figure out what the different BEAM codes do,
and the current implementation is not complete in any way.
